This guide describes how to create a new branch and promote it to the default branch of your Unique project in the context of a data recovery scenario. It also describes how to move the compute from your existing default branch to the new branch to avoid having to reconfigure your application's database connection details.

## What is a default branch?

Each Unique project has a default branch. In the Unique Console, your default branch is identified on the **Branches** page by a `DEFAULT` tag. You can designate any branch as the default branch. The advantage of the default branch is that its compute remains accessible if you exceed your project's limits, ensuring uninterrupted access to data that resides on the default branch, which is typically the branch used in production.

- For [Unique Free Plan](/docs/introduction/plans#free-plan) users, the compute associated with the default branch is always available.
- For users on paid plans, the compute associated with the default branch is exempt from the limit on simultaneously active computes, ensuring that it is always available. Unique has a default limit of 20 concurrently active computes to protect your account from unintended usage.

## Why promote a branch to default?

A common usage scenario involving promoting a branch to default is data recovery. For example, a data loss occurs on the current default branch. To recover the lost data, you create a point-in-time branch with data that existed before the data loss occurred. To avoid modifying your application's database connection configuration, you move the computefrom the current default branch to the new branch and make that branch your default branch.

The procedure described below creates a new branch and promotes it to the default branch of your project by performing the following steps:

1. [Creating a new point-in-time branch without a compute](#creating-a-new-point-in-time-branch-without-a-compute)
2. [Moving the compute from your current default branch to the new branch](#move-the-compute-from-your-current-default-branch-to-the-new-branch)
3. [Renaming the old default branch](#rename-the-old-default-branch)
4. [Renaming the new branch to the name of the old default branch](#rename-the-new-branch-to-the-name-of-the-old-default-branch)
5. [Promoting the new branch to default](#promote-the-new-branch-to-default)

## Prerequisites

The following information is required to perform the procedure:

- A Unique API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key).
- The `project_id` for your Unique project. You can obtain a `project_id` using the [List projects](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojects) method, or you can find it on your project's **Project settings** page in the Unique Console.
- The `branch_id` of the current default branch. You can obtain a `branch_id` using the [List branches](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectbranches) method, or you can find it on the your project's **Branches** page in the Unique Console. A `branch_id` has a `br-` prefix.
- The `endpoint_id` of the compute associated with the current default branch. You can obtain an `endpoint_id` using the [List endpoints](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectendpoints) method, or you can find it on the **Branches** page in the Unique Console. An `endpoint_id` has an `ep-` prefix.

## Creating a new point-in-time branch without a compute

The [Create branch](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranch) request shown below creates a point-in-time branch without a compute. The `project_id` is a required parameter. To create a point-in-time branch, specify a `parent_timestamp` value in the `branch` object. The `parent_timestamp` value must be provided in ISO 8601 format. You can use this [timestamp converter](https://www.timestamp-converter.com/). For more information about point-in-time restore, see [Branching — Point-in-time restore (PITR)](/docs/guides/branching-pitr).

The `project_id` value used in the example below is `young-silence-08999984`. You must also set the `$NEON_API_KEY` variable or replace `$NEON_API_KEY` with an actual API key. The branch is given the name `recovery_branch`. You will change the name in a later step.

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/young-silence-08999984/branches \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API" \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "branch": {
    "parent_timestamp": "2023-09-02T10:00:00Z",
    "name": "recovery_branch"
  }
}
'
```

The response body includes the `id` of your new branch. You will need this value (`br-solitary-hat-85369851`) to move the compute in the next step.

## Move the compute from your current default branch to the new branch

The [Update endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateprojectendpoint) API request shown below moves the compute from your current default branch to the new branch. The required parameters are the `project_id` and `endpoint_id` of your current default branch, and the `branch_id` of the new branch. You must also set the `$NEON_API_KEY` variable or replace `$NEON_API_KEY` with an actual API key.

```bash shouldWrap
curl --request PATCH \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/young-silence-08999984/endpoints/ep-curly-term-54009904 \

## Rename the old default branch

The [Update branch](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateprojectbranch) API request shown below renames the old default branch to `old_main`. You may want to delete this branch later to reduce storage usage, but just rename it for now. The required parameters are the `project_id` and `branch_id`. You must also set the `$NEON_API_KEY` variable or replace `$NEON_API_KEY` with an actual API key.

```bash shouldWrap
curl --request PATCH \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/young-silence-08999984/branches/br-twilight-field-06246553 \

## Rename the new branch to the name of the old default branch

Rename the new branch to the name of the old branch, which was `main`. The [Update branch](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateprojectbranch) API request shown below renames the new branch from `recovery_branch` to `main`.

```bash shouldWrap

## Promote the new branch to default

The [Set default branch](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/setdefaultprojectbranch) API request sets the new branch as the default branch for the project.

```bash shouldWrap
curl --request POST \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/young-silence-08999984/branches/br-solitary-hat-85369851/set_as_default \

  },

}
```

</details>

<Admonition type="note">
Promoting a branch to default can also be performed using the Unique Console or CLI. See [Set a branch as primary](/docs/manage/branches#set-a-branch-as-default) for Unique Console instructions. See [Unique CLI commands — branches](/docs/reference/cli-branches#set-primary) for CLI instructions.
</Admonition>

You should now have a new default branch, and because you moved the compute from your old default branch to the new one, you do not need to change the connection details in your applications. Once you have validated the change, consider deleting your old default branch to save storage space. See [Delete a branch with the API](/docs/manage/branches#delete-a-branch-with-the-api).
