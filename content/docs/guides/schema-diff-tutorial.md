In this guide we will create an initial schema on a new database called `people` on our `main` branch. We'll then create a development branch called `dev/jordan`, following our recommended convention for naming development branches. After making schema changes on `dev/jordan`, we'll use the **Schema Diff** tool on the **Branches** page to get a side-by-side, Github-style visual comparison between the `dev/jordan` development branch and `main`.

## Before you start

To complete this tutorial, you'll need:

- A Unique account. Sign up [here](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up).
- To interact with your Unique database from the command line:

  - Install the [Unique CLI](/docs/reference/cli-install)
  - Download and install the [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) client

## Step 1: Create the Initial Schema

First, create a new database called `people` on the `main` branch and add some sample data to it.

<Tabs labels={["Console", "CLI"]}>

<TabItem>

1. Create the database.

   In the **Unique Console**, go to **Databases** &#8594; **New Database**. Make sure your `main` branch is selected, then create the new database called `people`.

1. Add the schema.

   Go to the **SQL Editor**, enter the following SQL statement and click **Run** to apply.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE person (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       name TEXT NOT NULL,
       email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
   );
   ```

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

1. Create the database.

   Use the following CLI command to create the `people` database.

   ```bash
   neon databases create --name people
   ```

   <Admonition type="note">
   If you have multiple projects, include `--project-id`. Or set the project context so you don't have to specify project id in every command. Example:

   ```bash
   neon set-context --project-id empty-glade-66712572
   ```

   You can find your project ID on the **Project settings** page in the Unique Console.

   </Admonition>

1. Copy your connection string:

   ```bash
   neon connection-string --database-name people
   ```

1. Connect to the `people` database with psql:

   ```bash
   psql 'postgresql://neondb_owner:*********@ep-crimson-frost-a5i6p18z.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/people?sslmode=require'
   ```

1. Create the schema:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE person (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       name TEXT NOT NULL,
       email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
   );
   ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Create a development branch

Create a new development branch off of `main`. This branch will be an exact, isolated copy of `main`.

For the purposes of this tutorial, name the branch `dev/jordan`, following our recommended convention of creating a long-lived development branch for each member of your team.

<Tabs labels={["Console", "CLI"]}>

<TabItem>

1. Create the development branch

   On the **Branches** page, click **Create Branch**, making sure of the following:

   - Select `main` as the default branch.
   - Name the branch `dev/jordan`.

1. Verify the schema on your new branch

   From the **SQL Editor**, use the meta-command `\d person` to inspect the schema of the `person` table. Make sure that the `people` database on the branch `dev/jordan` is selected.

   ![use metacommand to inspect schema](/docs/guides/schema_diff_d_metacommand.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

1. Create the branch

   If you're still in `psql`, exit using `\q`.

   Using the Unique CLI, create the development branch. Include `--project-id` if you have multiple projects.

   ```bash
   neon branches create --name dev/jordan --parent main
   ```

1. Verify the schema

   To verify that this branch includes the initial schema created on `main`, connect to `dev/jordan`, then view the `person` table.

   1. Get the connection string for the `people` database on branch `dev/jordan` using the CLI.

      ```bash
      neon connection-string dev/jordan --database-name people
      ```

      This gives you the connection string which you can then copy.

      ```bash
      postgresql://neondb_owner:*********@ep-hidden-rain-a5pe72oi.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/people?sslmode=require
      ```

   1. Connect to `people` using psql.

      ```bash
      psql 'postgresql://neondb_owner:*********@ep-hidden-rain-a5pe72oi.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/people?sslmode=require'
      ```

   1. View the schema for the `person` table we created earlier.

      ```bash
      \d person
      ```

      Which shows you the schema:

      ```bash
      Table "public.person"
      Column |  Type   | Collation | Nullable |              Default
      --------+---------+-----------+----------+------------------------------------
      id     | integer |           | not null | nextval('person_id_seq'::regclass)
      name   | text    |           | not null |
      email  | text    |           | not null |
      Indexes:
          "person_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
          "person_email_key" UNIQUE CONSTRAINT, btree (email)
      ```

      You can do the same thing for your `main` branch and get identical results.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Update schema on a dev branch

Let's introduce some differences between the two branches. Add a new table to store addresses on the `dev/jordan` branch.

<Tabs labels={["Console","CLI"]}>

<TabItem>
In the **SQL Editor**, make sure you select `dev/jordan` as the branch and `people` as the database.

Enter this SQL statemenet to create a new `address` table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE address (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    person_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    street TEXT NOT NULL,
    city TEXT NOT NULL,
    state TEXT NOT NULL,
    zip_code TEXT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (person_id) REFERENCES person(id)
);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

1. Connect to dev/jordan

   By adding `--psql` to the CLI command, you can start the `psql` connection without having to enter the connection string directly:

   ```bash
   neon connection-string dev/jordan --database-name people --psql
   ```

   Response:

   ```bash
   INFO: Connecting to the database using psql...
   psql (16.1, server 16.2)
   SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, compression: off)
   Type "help" for help.

   people=>
   ```

1. Add a new address table

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE address (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       person_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
       street TEXT NOT NULL,
       city TEXT NOT NULL,
       state TEXT NOT NULL,
       zip_code TEXT NOT NULL,
       FOREIGN KEY (person_id) REFERENCES person(id)
   );
   ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: View the schema differences

Now that you have some differences between your branches, you can view the schema differences.

<Tabs labels={["Console", "CLI"]}>

<TabItem>

1. Click on `dev/jordan` to open the detailed view, then under **Compare to Parent** click **Open schema diff**.

   ![select branches for schema diff](/docs/guides/schema_diff_make_selection.png)

1. Make sure you select `people` as the database and then click **Compare**.

   ![schema diff results](/docs/guides/schema_diff_result.png)

You will see the schema differences between `dev/jordan` and its parent `main`, including the new address table that we added to the `dev/jordan` branch.

You can also launch Schema Diff from the **Restore** page, usually as part of verifying schemas before you restore a branch to its own or another branch's history. See [Branch restore](/docs/guides/branch-restore) for more info.

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

Compare the schema of `dev/jordan` to its parent branch using the `schema-diff` command.

```bash
neon branches schema-diff main dev/jordan --database people
```

The result shows a comparison between the `dev/jordan` branch and its parent branch for the database `people`. The output indicates that the `address` table and its related sequences and constraints have been added in the `dev/jordan` branch but are not present in its parent branch `main`.
