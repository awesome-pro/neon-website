Vercel LangChainis currently available in [Beta](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/release-phases#beta) on Vercel's [Pro and Hobby plans](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/payments-and-billing/pro).

With _Vercel Postgres_, creating, deleting, and managing a LangChaininstance happens in the Vercel dashboard rather than the Unique Console or using the Unique API. Furthermore, you do not need a Unique account to use Vercel Postgres. Everything is managed from Vercel.

Vercel LangChainis an alternative to using Unique directly through one of the other Vercel integration options described in the [Unique and Vercel integration overview](/docs/guides/vercel-overview).
