[Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas) are supported with the Neon paid plans. This guide will lead you through the process of creating and managing read replicas.

The general methodology of using read replicas to segregate read-only work from your production database operations can be applied to a variety of uses cases, such as:

- Offloading analytics or reporting queries
- Distributing read requests to achieve higher throughput
- Providing read-only data access to specific users or applications who do not need to modify data
- Configuring different CPU and memory resources for each read replica for different users and applications

Regardless of the application, the steps for creating, configuring, and connecting to a read replica are the same. You can create one or more read replicas for any branch in your Neon project and configure the vCPU and memory allocated to each. Neon's _Autoscaling_ and _Autosuspend_ features are also supported, providing you with control over compute usage.

## Prerequisites

- A Neon paid plan account
- A [Neon project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).

## Create a read replica

Creating a read replica involves adding a read replica compute to a branch. You can add a read replica compute to any branch in your Neon project using the Neon Console, [Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-branches#create), or [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint).

<Tabs labels={["Console", "CLI", "API"]}>

<TabItem>
To create a read replica from the Neon Console:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
2. Select the branch where your database resides.
3. Click **Add Read Replica**.
4. On the **Add new compute** dialog, select **Read replica** as the **Compute type**.
5. Specify the **Compute size** options. You can configure a **Fixed Size** compute with a specific amount of vCPU and RAM (the default) or enable autoscaling by configuring a minimum and maximum compute size. You can also configure the **Suspend compute after inactivity** setting, which is the amount of idle time after which your compute is automatically suspended. The default setting is 5 minutes.
   <Admonition type="note">
   The compute size configuration determines the processing power of your database.
   </Admonition>
6. When you finish making your selections, click **Create**.

In a few moments, your read replica is provisioned and appears on the **Computes** tab on the **Branches** page. The following section describes how to connect to your read replica.
</TabItem>

<TabItem>

To create a read replica using the Neon CLI, use the [branches](/docs/reference/cli-branches) command, specifying the `add-compute` subcommand with `--type read_only`. If you have more than one Neon project, also include the `--project-id` option.

```bash
neon branches add-compute mybranch --type read_only
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

To create a read replica compute using the Neon API, use the [Create endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint) method. The `type` attribute in the following example specifies `read_only`, which creates a read replica compute. For information about obtaining the required `project_id` and `branch_id` parameters, refer to [Create an endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint), in the _Neon API reference_.

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project_id>/endpoints \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "endpoint": {
    "type": "read_only",
    "branch_id": "<branch_id>"
  }
}
' | jq
```

</TabItem>

## Connect to a read replica

Connecting to a read replica is the same as connecting to any branch, except you connect via a read replica compute instead of your primary read-write compute. The following steps describe how to connect to your read replica with connection details obtained from the Neon Console.

1. On the Neon **Dashboard**, under **Connection Details**, select the branch, the database, and the role you want to connect with.
1. Under **Compute**, select a **Replica**.
1. Select a connection string or a code example from the drop-down menu and copy it. This is the information you need to connect to the read replica from you client or application.

   A **psql** connection string appears similar to the following:

   ```bash
   postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
   ```

   If you expect a high number of connections, select **Pooled connection** to add the `-pooler` flag to the connection string or example.

   No write operations are permitted on a connection to a read replica.

## View read replicas

You can view read replicas using the Neon Console or [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint).

<Tabs labels={["Console", "API"]}>

<TabItem>
To view read replicas for a branch, select **Branches** in the Neon Console, and select a branch. Under the **Computes** heading, the **Type** field identifies your read replicas. Read replicas have a `R/O` value instead of `R/W`.

![View read replicas](/docs/guides/view_read_replica.png)
</TabItem>

<TabItem>
To view read replica computes with the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint), use the [Get endpoints](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectendpoints) method.

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project_id>/endpoints' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY"
```

For information about obtaining the required `project_id` parameter for this command, refer to [Get endpoints](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectendpoints), in the _Neon API reference_. For information about obtaining an Neon API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key).

In the response body for this method, read replica computes are identified by the `type` value, which is `read_only`.
</TabItem>

## Edit a read replica

You can edit a read replica using the Neon Console or [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api) to change the [Compute size](/docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration) or [Autosuspend](/docs/manage/endpoints#auto-suspend-configuration) configuration.

<Tabs labels={["Console", "API"]}>

<TabItem>
To edit a read replica compute using the Neon Console:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. Under **Computes**, identify the read replica compute you want to modify, and click **Edit**.
1. Specify your settings click **Save**.

</TabItem>

<TabItem>
To edit a read replica compute with the Neon API, use the [Update endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateprojectendpoint) method.

```bash
curl --request PATCH \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project_id>/endpoints/<endpoint_id> \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "endpoint": {
    "autoscaling_limit_min_cu": 25,
    "autoscaling_limit_max_cu": 3,
    "suspend_timeout_seconds": 604800,
    "provisioner": "k8s-neonvm"
  }
}
'
```

Computes are identified by their `project_id` and `endpoint_id`. For information about obtaining the required `project_id` and `endpoint_id` parameters, refer to [Update endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateprojectendpoint), in the _Neon API reference_. For information about obtaining an Neon API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key).

## Delete a read replica

You can delete a read replica using the Neon Console or [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). Deleting a read replica is a permanent action, but you can quickly create a new read replica if you need one.

<Tabs labels={["Console", "API"]}>

<TabItem>
To delete a read replica using the Neon Console:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. On the **Computes** tab, find the read replica you want to delete.
1. Click **Edit** &#8594; **Delete**.

</TabItem>

<TabItem>
To delete a read replica compute with the Neon API, use the [Delete endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/deleteprojectendpoint) method.

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project_id>/endpoints/<endpoint_id> \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY"
```

Computes are identified by their `project_id` and `endpoint_id`. For information about obtaining the required `project_id` and `endpoint_id` parameters, refer to [Delete endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/deleteprojectendpoint), in the _Neon API reference_.

## Default and read replica compute setting synchronization

In a LangChainprimary-standby configuration, certain settings should be no smaller on a standby than on the primary in order to ensure that the standby does not run out of shared memory during recovery, as described in the [PostgreSQL hot standby documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/hot-standby.html#HOT-STANDBY-ADMIN). For Neon [read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas), it's no different. The same settings should be no smaller on a read replica compute (the "standby") than on your primary read-write compute (the "primary"). For this reason, the following settings on read replica computes are synchronized with the settings on the primary read-write compute when the read replica compute is started:

- `max_connections`
- `max_prepared_transactions`
- `max_locks_per_transaction`
- `max_wal_senders`
- `max_worker_processes`
