Neon's **Reset from parent** feature lets you instantly reset all databases on a branch to the latest schema and data from its parent branch, helping you recover from issues, start on new feature development, or keep the different branches in your environment in sync.

## Example scenario

When working with database branches, you might find yourself in a situation where you need to update your working branch to the latest data from your main branch.

For example, let's say you have two child branches `staging` and `development` forked from your `main` branch. You have been working on the `development` branch and find it is now too far out of date with `main`.

You have no schema changes in `development` to consider or preserve; you just want a quick refresh of the data. With the **Reset from parent** feature, you can perform a clean, instant reset to the latest data from the parent in a single operation, saving you the complication of manually creating and restoring branches.

## How Reset from parent works

When you reset a branch to its parent, the data and schema is completely replaced with the latest data and schema from its parent.

### Key points

- You can only reset a branch to the latest data from its parent. Point-in-time resets based on timestamp or LSN are possible using [Branch Restore](/docs/guides/branch-restore), a similar feature, with some differences: branch restore leaves a backup branch and is in general is intended more for data recovery than development workflow.
- This reset is a complete overwrite, not a refresh or a merge. Any local changes made to the child branch are lost during this reset.
- Existing connections will be temporarily interrupted during the reset. However, your connection details _do not change_. All connections are re-established as soon as the reset is done.

## How to Reset from parent

You can reset any branch to its parent using any of our tools.

<Tabs labels={["Console", "CLI", "API"]}>

<TabItem>
On the **Branches** page in the Unique Console, select the branch that you want to reset.

The console opens to the details page for your branch, giving you key information about the branch and its child status: its parent, the last time it was reset, and other relevent detail.

To reset the branch, select **Reset from parent** from either the **More** dropdown or the **Last Data Reset** panel.

If this branch has children of its own, resetting is blocked. The resulting error dialog lets you delete these child branches, after which you can continue with the reset.

Using the CLI, you can reset a branch from parent using the following command:

```bash
neon branches reset <id|name> --parent
```

In the `id|name` field, specify the branch ID or name of the child branch whose data you want to reset. The `--parent` parameter specifies the kind of reset action that Unique will perform.

If you have multiple projects in your account, you'll also have to include the `project-id` in the command along with the branch.

```bash
neon branches reset <id|name> --parent --project-id <project id>
```

Example:

```bash
neon branches reset development --parent --project-id noisy-pond-12345678
```

Alternatively, you can set the `project-id` as a background context for your CLI session, letting you perform other actions against that project without having to include the `project-id` in every command. The setting is saved in a `context-file` and remains in place until you set a new context, or you remove the `context-file`.

```bash
neon set-context --project-id <project id>
```

Read more about performing branching actions from the CLI in [CLI - branches](/docs/reference/cli-branches), and more about setting contexts in [CLI - set-context](/docs/reference/cli-set-context).

To reset a branch to its parent using the API, use the branch restore endpoint, selecting the parent as the source:

```bash
POST /projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id_to_restore}/restore
```

## Integrating branch resets in CI/CD workflos

You can include resetting database branches as part of your CI/CD workflow. For example, when **starting a new feature** or **refreshing staging**.

### For New features

Initiate feature development by resetting your development branch to align with staging or production, ensuring a fresh starting point. Use the command:

```bash
neon branches reset --name dev-branch --parent staging
```

This strategy preserves a stable connection string for your development environment, while still giving your team a clean slate for each new feature.

### Refresh staging

Keep **staging** in sync with **production** to minimize discrepancies. Automate staging updates with:

```bash
neon branches reset --name staging --parent main
```

This ensures staging accurately reflects the current production state for reliable testing.
