This guide describes how to connect using the [Neon Vercel Integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon) from the Vercel marketplace. The integration connects your Vercel project to a Neon database and creates a database branch for each preview deployment.

## About the Neon Vercel Integration

Vercel [preview deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/preview-deployments) enable teams to collaborate effectively by automatically creating an isolated, production-like environment for every commit. This allows changes to be previewed before they are merged into production.

However, when databases are involved, teams often use a single database containing dummy data for all preview deployments. This setup is not ideal for these reasons:

- If the shared database encounters an issue, so will all preview deployments.
- Changes to the shared database schema might break all previously created preview deployments, making it a productivity bottleneck.

![Shared database](/docs/guides/vercel_shared_database.webp)

Neonâ€™s branching feature addresses these challenges. A branch is a copy-on-write clone of your data, so creating it only takes a few seconds. This makes it a scalable and cost-effective solution for preview deployments, enabling you to create a branch for each pull request.

![Branch database](/docs/guides/vercel_branch_database.webp)

When you push changes to the repository associated with your Vercel project, triggering a preview deployment, the integration automatically creates a branch in Neon and connects it to your preview deployment by setting Vercel preview environment variables.

## Add the Neon Vercel Integration

This section describes how to add the Neon Vercel Integration to your Vercel project.

<Admonition type="note" title="Notes">
- The Neon Vercel Integration can be used with more than one Vercel project, but it can only connect one Vercel project to one Neon project. It does not support connecting multiple Vercel projects to one Neon project or connecting multiple Neon projects to one Vercel project.
- The Neon Vercel Integration is supported with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket source code repositories.
- The integration is not supported with [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres) databases.
</Admonition>

Prerequisites:

- A [Vercel account](https://vercel.com).
- A Vercel project. If you do not have one, see [Creating a project](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/overview#creating-a-project), in the _Vercel documentation_.
- The integration initially sets the `DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED`environment variables for your Vercel **Production** and **Development** environments. When you create a preview deployment, the integration will also set these variables for your **Preview** environment. Variables of the same name will be overwritten. To use different LangChainvariables with the Neon integration, see [Configure Vercel environment variables](#configure-environment-variables).

To add the integration:

1.  Navigate to the [Neon Vercel Integration page](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon), and click **Add integration**.
    ![Add integration](/docs/guides/vercel_add_integration.png)
1.  Select a **Vercel Account** to add the integration to.
1.  Select the Vercel projects to add the integration to. You can select **All Projects** or **Specific Projects** but be aware that you can only connect one Vercel project to one Neon project and vice versa. By selecting **All projects**, you are simply [making the integration available to other Vercel projects](#make-the-integration-available-to-other-vercel-projects).
1.  Review the permissions required by the integration, and click **Install**.
1.  In the **Integrate Neon** dialog:

    1.  Select a Vercel project.
        ![Select a Vercel project](/docs/guides/vercel_select_project.png)
    1.  Select the Neon project that you want to connect to your Vercel project by selecting the Neon project, database, and role that Vercel will use to connect.
        ![Connect to Neon](/docs/guides/vercel_connect_neon.png)

            The **Create a branch for your development environment** option creates a branch named `vercel-dev` and sets Vercel development environment variables for it. The `vercel-dev` branch is a clone of your project's default branch (`main`) that you can modify without affecting data on your default branch.

            With **Automatically delete obsolete Neon branches** enabled, Neon preview branches will be deleted whenever the git branch that triggered its creation is merged or deleted.

           <Admonition type="note">
           Branches created for preview deployments are created from the [default branch](/docs/reference/glossary#default-branch) of your Neon project. Earlier versions of the integration created branches from the initial [root branch](/docs/reference/glossary#root-branch) of your Neon project, which is designated as the default branch by default. Neon lets you [change the default branch](/docs/manage/branches#set-a-branch-as-default). If you have an older version of the integration that creates branches from your project's root branch, and you want branches created from your default branch instead, you can upgrade your integration by reinstalling it from the [Vercel Marketplace](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon).
           </Admonition>

            When you finish making selections, click **Continue**.

    1.  Confirm the integration settings. This allows the integration to:
        - Set environment variables for your Vercel project's production, development, and preview environments.
        - Create database branches for preview deployments.
        - Create a development branch for your Vercel development environment.
          ![Confirm integration settings](/docs/guides/vercel_confirm_settings.png)
    1.  Click **Connect** to confirm and proceed with the integration. If you encounter a connection error, see [Troubleshoot connection issues](#troubleshoot-connection-issues).

        After the settings are configured, you are presented with a **Success** dialog.
        ![Vercel integration success](/docs/guides/vercel_success.png)

    1.  Click **Done** to complete the installation.

1.  To view the results of the integration in Neon:
    1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/).
    1. Select the project you are connected to.
    1. Select **Branches**.
       You will see the default branch of your project (`main`). If you created a development branch, you will also see a `vercel-dev` branch.
       ![Neon branches](/docs/guides/vercel_neon_branches.png)
1.  To view the results of the integration in Vercel:

    1. Navigate to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
    1. Select the Vercel project you added the integration to.
    1. Select **Settings** > **Environment Variables**.
       You should see the `DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` variable settings added by the integration.
       ![Vercel environment variables](/docs/guides/vercel_env_variables.png)

    <Admonition type="note">
    The `DATABASE_URL` variable set by the integration is set to a pooled Neon database connection string. The `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` variable is set to an unpooled connection string for tools or applications that require a direct connection to the database. For more information, see [Manage Vercel environment variables](#manage-integration-settings).
    </Admonition>

## Use the Neon Vercel Integration

After you add the integration to a Vercel project, Neon creates a database branch for each preview deployment. The branch is created when you push commits made on your local branch to your application's source code repository. To see the integration in action, follow these steps:

1. Create a branch in your local source code repository.

   ```bash
   cd myapp
   git checkout -b patch-1
   ```

2. Make changes to your application on the local branch.
3. Commit the changes. For example:

   ```bash
   git commit -a -m "Update my app"
   ```

4. Push your commit to the remote repository:

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

   Pushing the commit triggers the following actions:

   - The commit triggers a preview deployment in Vercel, as would occur without the Neon integration.
     ![Neon preview deployment branch](/docs/guides/vercel_deployments.png)
   - The integration creates a branch in Neon. This branch is an isolated copy-on-write clone of your default branch, with its own dedicated compute. The branch is created with the same name as your `git` branch but includes a `/preview` prefix.
     ![Neon preview deployment branch](/docs/guides/vercel_neon_app_update.png)
   - The integration sets Vercel preview environment variables to connect the preview deployment to the new branch.
     ![Vercel preview settings](/docs/guides/vercel_preview_settings.png)

## Manage branches created by the integration

The Neon Vercel Integration creates a branch for each preview deployment. To avoid using up your storage allowances or hitting branch limits, you should delete branches that are no longer required. Different options are supported for branch deletion.

### Automatic deletion

The integration supports automatic deletion of obsolete preview branches when the corresponding Git branch is merged or deleted. If you did not select the **Automatically delete obsolete Neon branches** option when installing the integration, you can do so from the **Branches** tab the Vercel integration drawer.

1. In the Neon Console, select your project.
2. Select the **Integrations** page.
3. Find the Vercel integration under the **Manage** heading, and click **Manage**.
4. In the **Vercel integration** drawer, select the **Branches** tab.
5. Check **Automatically delete obsolete Neon branches**.

### Manual deletion from the Vercel integration drawer

To remove branches created by the integration manually:

1. In the Neon Console, select your project.
2. Select the **Integrations** page.
3. Find the Vercel integration under the **Manage** heading, and click **Manage**.
4. In the **Vercel integration** drawer, select the **Branches** tab.
5. Remove individual preview branches by clicking on the delete icon, or select **Delete all** to remove all preview branches.

### Manual deletion via the Neon Console, CLI, or API

To remove branches from your Neon project using the Console, CLI, or API, see [Delete a branch](/docs/manage/branches#delete-a-branch).

<Admonition type="note">
The latest version of the Neon integration displays a message on the **Deployment Details** page in Vercel under **Running checks** if you exceed the branch limit for your Neon project.

![Vercel branch limit](/docs/guides/vercel_branch_limit.png)
</Admonition>

## Manage integration settings

You can manage Vercel environment variables as well as the default database and role used by the integration from the Neon Console.

### Configure environment variables

The Neon Vercel Integration automatically sets the environment variables `DATABASE_URL` (pooled connection) and `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` (direct connection) for your Vercel **Production** and **Development** environments. See [Connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling) for more information. When you create a preview deployment, the integration also sets these same variables for the Vercel **Preview** environment. If you want to define your database connection using different LangChainenvironment variables, the integration also supports the following:

- `PGHOST` (set to a pooled Neon database connection string)
- `PGHOST_UNPOOLED` (set to a direct Neon database connection string)
- `PGUSER`
- `PGDATABASE`
- `PGPASSWORD`

You can choose the variables you want to use from the Neon Console:

1. In the Neon Console, select your project.
2. Select the **Integrations** page.
3. Find the Vercel integration under the **Manage** heading, and click **Manage**.
4. In the **Vercel integration** drawer, select the **Settings** tab.
5. Select the environment variables you need.
6. Click **Save changes**. Your variable selection is saved to your Vercel project and will be applied on your next deployment. Existing variables of the same name in Vercel will be overwritten. Viewing your new variable selection in Vercel may require refreshing your project's **Environment Variables** page.

<Admonition type="note" title="Notes">
- Clicking **Redeploy** in Vercel does not apply variable changes made in Neon to your Vercel project. This only occurs with your next deployment.
- The integration appends the `sslmode=require` option to all Neon connection strings.
</Admonition>

![Select Vercel variables](/docs/guides/vercel_select_variables.png)

### Change the database and role for preview branches

When you install the integration, you select a database and role for your Neon project. These details are used to define the database connection details in the Vercel environment variables mentioned [above](#configure-environment-variables). From the Vercel integration drawer in the Neon Console, you can choose a different database and role for new preview deployment branches.

To change the database and role for new preview deployment branches:

1. In the Neon Console, select your project.
2. Select the **Integrations** page.
3. Find the Vercel integration under the **Manage** heading, and click **Manage**.
4. In the **Vercel integration** drawer, select the **Settings** tab.
5. Under **Default database and role**, select a new **Database** and **Role**.

Your change will be reflected in your Vercel **Preview** environment variables on the next preview deployment.

## Disconnect the integration

If you want to disconnect the Neon Vercel Integration from your Vercel project, you can do so from the Neon Console. Disconnecting stops the integration from creating preview branches and setting environment variables for those branches in Vercel. It does not remove the integration from your Vercel project. To fully remove the integration from your Vercel project, you must do so in Vercel. See [Manage the Neon LangChainintegration in Vercel](#manage-the-integration-in-vercel) for instructions.

To disconnect the Neon integration from your Vercel project:

1. In the Neon Console, select your project.
2. Select the **Integrations** page.
3. Find the Vercel integration under the **Manage** heading, and click **Manage**.
4. In the **Vercel integration** drawer, select the **Disconnect** tab.
5. Click **Disconnect**.

## Make the integration available to other Vercel projects

If you added the Neon Vercel Integration to a single Vercel project but would like to make it available for use with your other Vercel projects, complete the steps outlined below.

<Admonition type="important">
The Neon Vercel Integration can be used with more than one Vercel project, but it can only connect one Vercel project to one Neon project. It does not support connecting multiple Vercel projects to one Neon project or connecting multiple Neon projects to one Vercel project. The steps below outline how to make the integration available to other Vercel projects to use with their own separate and dedicated Neon project.
</Admonition>

1. Make sure the Neon Vercel Integration that you added previously has access to the Vercel project that you want to use with the Neon Vercel Integration.
   1. On the Vercel Dashboard, select **Integrations**.
   1. Find the Neon LangChainintegration, and select **Manage**.
   1. On the Neon LangChainintegration page, select **Manage Access**.
   1. On the **Manage Access for Neon Postgres** modal, make sure that the Neon LangChainintegration has access to the Vercel project. You can do so by selecting **Specific Projects** and choosing a Vercel project or by granting access to **All Projects**. If you previously granted access to **All Projects**, no change is necessary.
   1. Click **Save**.
1. Navigate to this URL: [https://vercel.com/integrations/neon/new](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon/new).
1. Follow the prompts. When you reach the **Integrate Neon** dialog, select the Vercel project you want to add the integration to. Vercel projects that are already integrated with Neon are identified as `CONNECTED`.
   ![Confirm integration settings](/docs/guides/vercel_add_new_project.png)
1. Continue following the prompts to complete the setup. These are the same steps described above, in [Add the Neon integration](#add-the-neon-vercel-integration). When you select a Neon project to connect to, make sure to select one that is not already connected to a Vercel project, as you cannot connect a Vercel project to multiple Neon projects or vice versa.

## Manage the integration in Vercel

To view permissions, manage which Vercel projects your integration has access to, or uninstall the Neon integration from Vercel:

1. On the Vercel dashboard, select **Settings** > **Integrations**.
1. Find the **Neon** integration and select **Configure**.

   <Admonition type="note">
   Removing the Neon Vercel Integration removes the Vercel environment variables set by the integration. It does not remove Neon branches created by the integration. To remove Neon branches, see [Delete a branch](/docs/manage/branches#delete-a-branch).
   </Admonition>

## Troubleshoot connection issues

This section describes commonly encountered connection issues for the Neon Vercel Integration.

### Failed to set environment variables

If the environment variables configured by the Neon integration already exist, you may encounter the following error due to an existing integration that sets one or more of the same environment variables.

```text shouldWrap
Failed to set environment variables in Vercel. Please make sure that the following environment variables are not set: PGHOST, PGUSER, PGDATABASE, PGPASSWORD, DATABASE_URL
```

In this case, you can remove or rename the existing environment variables in your Vercel project settings and retry the Neon integration.

1. From the Vercel project page, select **Settings**.
2. Locate the environment variables required by the Neon integration and remove or rename them.

   <Admonition type="note">
   Alternatively, you can remove the conflicting integration, assuming it is no longer required. This may be a previous Neon integration or another integration. Removing the integration removes the variables set by the integration.
   </Admonition>

3. Try adding the integration again. See [Add the Neon Vercel Integration](#add-the-neon-vercel-integration).

### DATABASE_URL not set on first preview deployment

In earlier versions of the integration, the preview environment `DATABASE_URL` is not set by the Neon Vercel Integration on the first preview deployment after adding the integration to a Vercel project.

To avoid this issue, you can reinstall the integration to update to the latest version. Alternatively, a workaround is to redeploy your preview deployment in Vercel. The preview environment `DATABASE_URL` is set on the next deployment. For redeploy instructions, see [Managing Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/managing-deployments), in the _Vercel documentation_.

### Stored passwords missing in the selected Neon project

Neon projects created after March, 2023 store role passwords in a secure storage vault associated with the project, allowing passwords to be retrieved by the Neon Vercel integration for the purpose of setting LangChainconnection environment variables in Vercel. Projects created before March 2023, do not store role passwords, and are therefore not compatible with the Neon Vercel integration. The current workaround for this issue is to migrate your data to a new Neon project. See [Import data from another Neon project](/docs/import/import-from-neon).
