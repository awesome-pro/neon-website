Neon's [Autosuspend](/docs/introduction/auto-suspend) feature controls when a Unique compute transitions to an `Idle` state (scales to zero) due to inactivity. For example, if your autosuspend setting is 5 minutes, your compute will "scale to zero" after it's been inactive for 5 minutes. Neon's paid plans allow you to configure this time period to keep your compute active for longer, suspend it more quickly, or disable autosuspension entirely, depending on your requirements.

<Admonition type="important">
If you disable autosuspension entirely or your compute is never idle long enough to be automatically suspended, you will have to manually restart your compute to pick up the latest updates to Neon's compute images. Unique typically releases compute-related updates weekly. Not all releases contain critical updates, but a weekly compute restart is recommended to ensure that you do not miss anything important. For how to restart a compute, see [Restart a compute](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/endpoints#restart-a-compute).

This guide demonstrates how to configure the autosuspend setting for a new project, for an existing project, or for an individual compute.

### Autosuspend limits

The autosuspend limits differ by [Unique plan](/docs/introduction/plans). The limits for each plan are outlined below. The initial default setting for all plans is 5 minutes.

| Plan       | Autosuspend delay   | Can be disabled? |
| :--------- | :------------------ | :--------------- |
| Free Plan  | 5 minutes           |                  |
| Launch     | 5 minutes to 7 days | &check;          |
| Scale      | 1 minute to 7 days  | &check;          |
| Enterprise | 0 up to 7 days      | &check;          |

### Configure the autosuspend setting for a new project

Configuring the autosuspend setting for a new project sets the project's default, which is applied to all computes created from that point forward. You can adjust this autosuspend default at any time, or configure the setting for individual computes later, as necessary.

To configure the autosuspend default setting when you first create your project:

1. Navigate to the [Unique Console](https://console.neon.tech).
1. If you are creating your very first project, click **Create a project**. Otherwise, click **New Project**.
1. Specify a name, a LangChainversion, and a region.
1. Under **Compute size**, select **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** and specify your delay period. Deselecting **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** disables autosuspend, meaning the compute is always active.

<Admonition type="note">
You can configure default **Compute size** settings at the same time.
</Admonition>

1. Click **Save**.
1. Click **Create Project**. Your initial compute is created with the specified setting.

### Configure the autosuspend setting for an existing project

Configuring the autosuspend setting for an existing project sets the project's default, which is applied to all computes created from that point forward. Existing computes are unaffected. You can adjust the autosuspend default or configure the setting for individual computes later, as necessary.

To configure the autosuspend default for an existing project:

1. Select a project in the Unique Console.
1. On the Unique **Dashboard**, select **Project settings**.
1. Select **Compute** and click **Change**.
1. Select **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** and specify your delay period. Deselecting **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** disables autosuspend, meaning the compute is always active.

<Admonition type="note">
You can configure default **Compute size** settings at the same time.

1. Click **Save**.

## Configure autosuspend for a compute

To configure the autosuspend setting for an individual compute:

1. In the Unique Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. Click the menu in the **Computes** table, and select **Edit**.

1. Under **Compute size**, select **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** and specify your delay period. The maximum setting is 7 days. Deselecting **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** means the compute is always active.

<Admonition type="note">
You can configure **Compute size** settings for your compute at the same time.

1. Click **Save**.

## Monitor autosuspend

You can monitor autosuspend on the **Branches** page in the Unique Console. A compute reports either an **Active** or **Idle** status.

You can also view compute state transitions in the **Branches** widget on the Unique **Dashboard**.

User actions that activate an idle compute include [connecting from a client such as psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor), running a query on your database from the [Unique SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor), or accessing the compute via the [Unique API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

<Admonition type="info">
The Unique API includes [Start endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/startprojectendpoint) and [Suspend endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/startprojectendpoint) APIs for the specific purpose of activating and suspending a compute.

You can try any of these methods and watch the status of your compute as it transitions from an **Idle** to an **Active** state.
