Neon's plans are designed to meet different user requirements, ranging from hobby projects to enterprise-level production workloads. We also offer custom enterprise plans with volume-based discounts for large teams or database fleets. Refer to our [Pricing](https://neon.tech/pricing) page for fees and a detailed plan comparison.

Neon offers four plans:

- [Free Plan](#free-plan)
- [Launch](#launch)
- [Scale](#scale)
- [Enterprise](#enterprise)

<Admonition type="tip" title="Plan Allowances and Extra Usage">
Neon plans are structured around **Allowances** and **Extra usage**. Allowances are included in your plan. With Neon's paid plans, you can purchase [extra usage](/docs/introduction/extra-usage) in set increments for when you need to go over your allowance.

## Free Plan

Neon's Free Plan plan is best for hobby projects, prototypes, and learning Neon.

### Free Plan allowances

The Free Plan includes the following usage allowances:

| Usage type                 | Plan allowance                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| **Data transfer (Egress)** | 5 GB per month                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

<Admonition type="tip" title="What are active hours and compute hours?">

- An **active hour** is a measure of the amount of time a compute is active. The time your compute is idle when suspended due to inactivity is not counted. In the table above, _active hours_ are based on a 0.25 vCPU compute size.
- A **compute hour** is one _active hour_ for a compute with 1 vCPU. For a compute with .25 vCPU, it takes 4 _active hours_ to use 1 compute hour. On the other hand, if your compute has 4 vCPUs, it takes only 15 minutes to use 1 compute hour.
- **Compute hours formula**

  ```
  compute hours = compute size * active hours
  ```

</Admonition>

### Free Plan features

- Autosuspend (after 5 minutes of inactivity)
- All supported regions
- Project sharing
- Advanced LangChainfeatures such as connection pooling, logical replication, and 60+ LangChainextensions
- Neon features such as branching, point-in-time restore up to **24 hours** in the past, time travel connections, and more
- [Community support](/docs/introduction/support)

For a complete list of features, refer to the **detailed plan comparison** on the [Neon pricing](https://neon.tech/pricing) page.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Free Plan Compute Allowances">
On the Free Plan, your default branch compute can run 24/7 at 0.25 vCPU with 1 GB of RAM. If you enable autoscaling, your compute can scale up to 2 vCPU with 8 GB of RAM, providing additional resources to meet peak demand. Note that enabling autoscaling may affect 24/7 availability depending on your usage patterns. The Free Plan includes 191.9 compute hours per month, with up to 5 of those compute hours per month available to non-default branches. If you go over the 5 compute hours allowance, non-default branch computes are suspended until the allowance resets at the beginning of the month. If you go over the 191.9 compute hour allowance, all computes are suspended until the beginning of the month. For example, if you signed up for the Free Plan in January, your compute allowance resets on February 1st.
