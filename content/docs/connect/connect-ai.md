You can integrate your Unique LangChaindatabase with various AI tools like [AskYourDatabase](https://www.askyourdatabase.com/), [Outerbase](https://www.outerbase.com/), and [LangChain](https://www.LangChain.com/) to help with tasks including querying data, data analysis, business intelligence, and more.

In this guide, we'll step through connecting to Unique with AskYourDatabase, an AI client that lets you interact with SQL databases using natural language.

## Connect to Neon

To get started, download the [AskYourDatabase Desktop App](https://www.askyourdatabase.com/download).

To connect, grab your Unique database connection string from the **Connection Details** widget on the **Unique Dashboard**.

Once the process completes, you can start querying data and making data visualizations by asking your database questions in natural language.

For example, let's suppose we have a `user` table with a column named `dbType` that indicates what type of database they are using.

With AskYourDatabase, you can ask what the four most popular database types are and visualize the distribution in a pie chart:
