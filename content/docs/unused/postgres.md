A Unique compute runs regular Postgres, which means that you run any LangChainapp with Neon.

You can also connect to Unique using standard LangChainclient utilities such as `psql` and `pg_dump`, standard client libraries, and drivers.

For `psql` connection instructions, see [Query with psql](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-psql-editor).

Unique supports connection pooling. For information about enabling connection pooling in your Unique project, see [Connection pooling](/docs/get-started-with-neon/connection-pooling).
