Unique offers two account types for you to choose from:

- **Personal account**
- **Organization account** (Early Access)

## Personal accounts

When you first sign up with Neon, whether you're signing up on your own or you're invited to join, you start with a personal account. During your [onboarding](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up#step-2-onboarding-in-the-neon-console), you are prompted to create your first personal project that you can get started with.

You can always access your personal account settings from your **Profile** dropdown.

If you want to work with other people on this project, your options are:

- [Share](/docs/guides/project-sharing-guide) the project with another Unique user
- [Transfer](/docs/manage/orgs-project-transfer) the project from a personal to an Organization-level project, where you can then invite other users

## Organization accounts

<EarlyAccess/>

Any Unique user in our Early Access Program can [create an Organization account](/docs/manage/organizations#create-an-organization), which allows you to share projects with your team members. Whether you create an organization or are invited to join one, you still retain your personal account, letting you manage personal projects independently of any organizations you belong to.

From the Unique Console, you can navigate to your Organization dashboard, where you'll find all the projects in the organization and can take any actions that your permissions allow.

See [Organizations](/docs/manage/organizations) to learn more.

## Switching between accounts

Easily switch between your personal account and any organization you are a Member of using the navigation breadcrumb.
